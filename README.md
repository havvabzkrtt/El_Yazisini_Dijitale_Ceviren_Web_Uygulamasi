# üñãÔ∏è Web Application for Converting Handwriting to Digital Text Using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a system that converts handwritten text from paper into digital format. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning model is used to classify handwritten characters and digits, and a user-friendly web interface allows for easy interaction with the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design and Methodology

### üîÑ Overall System Workflow

The system works through the following stages:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Uploading an image that contains handwritten text.
2. **Segmentation:** Splitting the image into lines and individual characters.
3. **Classification:** Assigning each character to the corresponding letter or digit class.
4. **Reconstruction:** Merging characters into words and sentences.
5. **Output Display:** Displaying the extracted text and allowing the user to download it as a PDF.

### üîç Methodology Details

#### 1. Data Preparation
- **MNIST** dataset was used for digits, and **EMNIST** for letters.
- The datasets were preprocessed and normalized before training.

#### 2. Segmentation Process
- **Line Segmentation:** The image is divided into horizontal lines.
- **Character Segmentation:** Characters are isolated and resized to 28x28 pixels.
- **Otsu Binarization** was used to reduce background interference and enhance clarity.

#### 3. CNN-Based Model Training
- A common CNN architecture was applied for both MNIST and EMNIST datasets.

**CNN Architecture Overview:**
- 3 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
- 3 Dense (fully connected) layers
- Dropout layers for overfitting prevention
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

**Training Accuracy:**
- MNIST: **99%**
- EMNIST: **93%**

#### 4. Web Application
- Developed using the **Flask** web framework.
- The interface accepts handwriting image uploads, processes them, and displays the recognized text both on-screen and as a downloadable PDF.

## üß™ Usage Steps

### 1. Login Page
- Users input basic information (e.g., name and surname).
- A template form to be digitalized is selected.

### 2. Image Upload
- The user uploads a photo of the handwritten form.
- The system allows the user to crop and isolate the handwriting region.

### 3. Displaying Results
- The processed text is shown in a table format on the screen.
- The user can also download the output as a **PDF** file.
